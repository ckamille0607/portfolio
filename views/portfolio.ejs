            <p class="infop">At first, I wasnâ€™t exactly sure what I wanted since I found it difficult to find the right
                tone to convey myself through a website.
                All I knew was that I wanted to create a simple yet elegant
                layout with large attention-grabbing texts, beautiful colors that goes well together, and have all the
                important information in one page to make it easy for the viewer to know everything they need to know
                about me.
            </p>
            <h6>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h6>
            <p class="infop">I used Adobe XD to play around with several ideas in mind to come up with a layout for my
                portfolio before finally coming up with these wireframes:</p>
            <img src="./images/lf.png" class="wireframes" alt="lo-fi design" draggable="false">
            <h6>Font Family and Color Palette</h6>
            <p class="infop">Yet another challenge was finding the right color palette. After hours of experimenting, I
                finally settled with a palette that allows me to use shades of pink without it being too bright or too
                loud.</p>
            <img src="./images/p1design.png" class="p1design" alt="design details" draggable="false">
            <h6>High Fidelity Wireframes for Desktop</h6>
            <p class="infop">Once I knew the color scheme I wanted, things started to come together much easier and
                faster. I was able to develop the high fidelity wireframes for the home page, about page, and projects
                page.</p>
            <img src="./images/hf.png" class="wireframes" alt="hi-fi design" draggable="false">
            <h6>Development</h6>
            <p class="infop">When I finished creating and designing the wireframes on Adobe XD, I was thrilled to start
                coding and bring the design to life. For majority of the layout, I chose to use flexbox because it
                suited my design better. Using flex direction made it easier for me to align the contents in the center
                and helped with making the entire page responsive.
            </p>
            <p class="infop">For the images and large headings, I decided to use vw instead of a fixed width for a more
                seamless experience when resizing the pages. Using this method saved me a lot of time as I didn't have
                to target all of these elements again when I was doing the media queries for smaller screens. I only had
                to adjust certain images and headings that I wanted bigger on mobile screens.
