            <p class="infop">This is one of the projects during my bootcamp program that I enjoyed learning about. It
                was my first time to formally study React and I was amazed by it. While it was a bit of a challenge
                understanding its structure at first, it became easier the more I practiced and played around with the
                code.

            <h6>Low Fidelity Wireframe</h6>
            <p class="infop">Here I started out with a very basic layout filled with a large heading for the title and
                several boxes for the cards that would show several of the new emojis.</p>
            <img src="./images/lf_emoji.png" class="wireframes" alt="lo-fi design" draggable="false">
            <h6>Font Family and Color Palette</h6>
            <p class="infop">I wanted to keep the colors simple and so, I only choose one bright color for the
                background and kept the rest neutral. This helps put the focus on the content of the cards.</p>
            <img src="./images/p2design.png" class="p1design" alt="design details" draggable="false">
            <h6>High Fidelity Wireframe Desktop</h6>
            <p class="infop">I followed the low fidelity wireframe closely and added a cool background that wouldn't
                clash with the card components. To make the cards stand out, I decided to use a box shadow
                with the color black to make the entries really pop out of the page.</p>
            <img src="./images/hf_emoji.png" class="wireframes" alt="hi-fi design" draggable="false">
            <h6>Development</h6>
            <p class="infop">I had a lot of fun recreating this project and designing the layout to my liking. The use
                of Reactâ€™s props made it a breeze to duplicate the entries multiple times without any extra code. Using
                flexbox wrap also made it easy for the page to become responsive without having to adjust all of the
                codes in the media query section.</p>
